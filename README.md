# 3D Print Error Detection System

This project is a deliverable prototype from the class ME266K at the University of Texas at Austin and was contributed by Kyle Hodowany, Rafiq Hamzeh, Manuel Salazar, and Travis Bouchard.

## Installation and Setup

Talk about hardware setup

Talk about package dependencies. (Possibly setup a requirements file for ease of setup)

Talk about running the application. (Possibly package to an executable with pyinstaller)

## How to Use

This is where we talk about how a complete noob is going to use the application, with screenshots of what certain buttons do

After the software has been downloaded, all dependencies installed, and the phsical setup configured, the 3D Print Error Detection System (EDS) can be used. First connect an Intel RealSense camera to your device using an appropriate cable. Then run the app.py file to start the application and display the GUI. An example of the GUI display is shown below.

## Technical Information

This is where we talk about how the systems work. We should reorganize the codebase into modules to make this more understandable

### 2D Image Similarity

### Stringing Machine Learning
```python
print("Hi")
```
### GUI

## Future Work

Talk about what could be done in the future of our project, e.g. new systems, performance improvements, usability features.
