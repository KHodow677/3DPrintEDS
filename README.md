## Installation and Setup

Talk about hardware setup

Talk about package dependencies. (Possibly setup a requirements file for ease of setup)

## Technical Information

This is where we talk about how the systems work. We should reorganize the codebase into modules to make this more understandable

### 2D Image Similarity

### Stringing Machine Learning

### GUI

## Future Work

Talk about what could be done in the future of our project, e.g. new systems, performance improvements, usability features.
